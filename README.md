# Tech-Blog
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well.

The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package to store session data.

## Getting Started

To begin the application, use the following in command line:

`
node server.js
`
<br>


## Installation

To run this application, you will need Node and other dependencies: 

1. You will need to install Node.js. Here is a link below:

[Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

<br>

2. Once you have downloaded Node.js, you will want to download node package manager (npm). In command line, you can enter:

`npm install -g npm
`

<br>

3. Next, install all the dependencies in the package.json. In command line, you can enter:

`npm install 
`

4. Additionally, you can download mysql database to store and access data:

[Download MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

<br>


5. Lastly, you will need to download Insomnia for testing API routes:

[Download Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)

<br>


<!-- ## Prerequisites
Requires node.js, npm inquirer, and npm jest (optional)

<br> -->


<!-- ## Test-Instructions

To test the API, I recommend downloading [Insomnia's API Platform](https://insomnia.rest/) and enter the following in Insomnia's URL:

>GET http://localhost:3000/api/notes

<br>

>POST http://localhost:3000/api/notes

Example POST body: 
```bash
{
  "title":"Notes Title",
  "text":"notes text content"
}
```
*id is automatically generated so you do not need to enter id

<br>
<br>

>DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/:id

<br>

Example DELETE: The API request below will delete note with id = "1"
>DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/1

<br> -->

## Code Snippets

This code snippet shows how you can use Express routes, Sequelize ORM, and JavaScript to create a get route for the hompaage so users can have access to all blog post data

* router.get('filepath') to request data from a specified source e.g. blog data post

* try/catch statement for error handling 

* async/await to for asynchronous promise-based behavior

* Sequelize .findAll() method to read the whole table from the database

* .map function to create a new array with a callback function for every array element. In this case, we wanted to use it to return a plain object

* res.render ('template.handlebars') to render a view with data 

```
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const postData = await Post.findAll({
      include: [
        {
          model: User,
          attributes: ['username'],
        },
        {
          model: Comment,
          attributes: ['comment_content', 'user_id', 'post_id',],
        },
      ],
    });

    const posts = postData.map((post) => post.get({ plain: true }));

    res.render('homepage', { 
      posts, 
    });
  } catch (err) {
   (Internal Server Error)
    res.status(500).json(err);
  }
});
```
