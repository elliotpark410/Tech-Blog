Employee Tracker is a command-line application to manage a company's employee database. With this application, you will be able to view and update 3 SQL tables (department, role, and employee). The purpose of this application is to have a Content Management System so that non-developers can easily view and interact with information stored in databases. The application uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [npm Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/).

## Getting-Started

To begin the application, use the following in command line:

```bash
node server.js
```
<br>


## Installation

1. You will need to install Node.js. Here is a link below:

>https://nodejs.org/en/download/

<br>

2. Once you have downloaded Node.js, you will want to download node package manager (npm). In command line, you can enter:

>npm install -g npm

<br>

3. After installing npm, you have to initialize npm. In command line, you can enter:

>npm init -y

<br>

4. Next, install Inquirer.js which is one of the many node packages. In command line, you can enter:

>npm install inquirer

<br>

5. Next, install console.table which is one of the many node packages. In command line, you can enter:

>npm install console.table

<br>

6. Next, install mysql2 which is one of the many node packages. In command line, you can enter:

>npm install mysql2

<br>

7. Lastly, you will need to download mysql:

>https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

<br>


<!-- ## Prerequisites
Requires node.js, npm inquirer, and npm jest (optional)

<br> -->


<!-- ## Test-Instructions

To test the API, I recommend downloading [Insomnia's API Platform](https://insomnia.rest/) and enter the following in Insomnia's URL:

>GET http://localhost:3000/api/notes

<br>

>POST http://localhost:3000/api/notes

Example POST body: 
```bash
{
  "title":"Notes Title",
  "text":"notes text content"
}
```
*id is automatically generated so you do not need to enter id

<br>
<br>

>DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/:id

<br>

Example DELETE: The API request below will delete note with id = "1"
>DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/1

<br> -->

## Code-Snippets

This code snippet shows how you can use SQL and npm mysql2 to create a function to view the departments table

* const sql uses Structured Query Language SELECT statement to display columns with an alias FROM the department table 

* ".query" is a built-in method in npm mysql2 to execute a query in the mysql database

* "console.table()" method displays tabular data as a table


```
function viewDepartments() {
  const sql =
    "SELECT department.id AS id, department.name AS department FROM department;";

  db.query(sql, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
    console.table(data);
    initPrompt();
  });
}
```
