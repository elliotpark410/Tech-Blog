# Tech-Blog
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package to store session data.

## Getting Started

To begin the application, use the following in command line:

`
node server.js
`
<br>


## Installation

To run this application, you will need Node and other dependencies: 

1. You will need to install Node.js. Here is a link below:

[Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

<br>

2. Once you have downloaded Node.js, you will want to download node package manager (npm). In command line, you can enter:

`npm install -g npm
`

<br>

3. Next, install all the dependencies in the package.json. In command line, you can enter:

`npm install 
`

4. Additionally, you can download mysql database to store and access data:

[Download MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

<br>


5. Lastly, you will need to download Insomnia for testing API routes:

[Download Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)

<br>


<!-- ## Prerequisites
Requires node.js, npm inquirer, and npm jest (optional)

<br> -->


<!-- ## Test-Instructions

To test the API, I recommend downloading [Insomnia's API Platform](https://insomnia.rest/) and enter the following in Insomnia's URL:

>GET http://localhost:3000/api/notes

<br>

>POST http://localhost:3000/api/notes

Example POST body: 
```bash
{
  "title":"Notes Title",
  "text":"notes text content"
}
```
*id is automatically generated so you do not need to enter id

<br>
<br>

>DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/:id

<br>

Example DELETE: The API request below will delete note with id = "1"
>DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/1

<br> -->

## Code Snippets

This code snippet shows how you can use Express routes, Sequelize ORM, and JavaScript to create a get route for the hompaage so users can have access to all blog post data

* router.get('filepath') to request data from a specified source e.g. blog data post

* try/catch statement for error handling 

* async/await to for asynchronous promise-based behavior

* Sequelize .findAll() method to read the whole table from the database

* .map function to create a new array with a callback function for every array element. In this case, we wanted to use it to return a plain object

* res.render ('template.handlebars') to render a view with data 

```
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const postData = await Post.findAll({
      include: [
        {
          model: User,
          attributes: ['username'],
        },
        {
          model: Comment,
          attributes: ['comment_content', 'user_id', 'post_id',],
        },
      ],
    });

    const posts = postData.map((post) => post.get({ plain: true }));

    res.render('homepage', { 
      posts, 
    });
  } catch (err) {
   (Internal Server Error)
    res.status(500).json(err);
  }
});
```
